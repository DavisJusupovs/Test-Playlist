# Test-Playlist

Hi. This is my playlist made for AGVibez coding challenge.
I know it does not include all the necessary rules.
This is my try as a begginer. 

This application can also be visited here: https://gentle-mountain-60765.herokuapp.com/

To run it localy you will have to clone this repository with the source : https://github.com/DavisJusupovs/Test-Playlist.git

When that is done you need to use the terminal 'npm init' and download all the necessary dependecies and they are : npm i body-parser ejs express lodash mongoose

Make another tab in terminal where you write mongod and leeave it there( It handles data requests, manages data access, and performs background management operations.) and in another one write mongo shell after that is done, type in the first terminal tab nodemon app.js to run the app.

You can visit the app on your browser using http://localhost:3000

Thank you for visit. 

Have a great day!
